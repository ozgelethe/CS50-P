#Assert

#Assert is a keyword in Python and some other languages as well that allow
#you to do exactly that, as in English, to assert that something is true,
#to sort of boldly claim that something is true. And if it is, nothing's
#going to happen. No errors are going to appear on the screen.
#But if you assert something in Python, and it is not true, that is,
#the thing you're insert asserting, a Boolean expression,
#is false, you're actually going to see some kind of error on the screen.
